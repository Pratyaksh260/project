        <p style="color:white; font-size: 20px;">
            At the very outset my message, I firmly believe that it is really a great pleasure to welcome you to the APS Srinagar website. The school Management and staff believe that every student is unique and special and that they all have the ability to learn. We believe it is our responsibility as educators to nurture and develop every student to his/her maximum potential. Students are continually encouraged to appreciate our diverse community and to care for others by becoming global citizens and develop a concern and active respect for the environment.
        </p><br>
        <p style="color:white; font-size: 20px;">At APS Srinagar, the educational community strives for excellence by preparing students for learning beyond their school years and assisting them to become lifelong learners, as well as helping them to be self-directed, realistic, and responsible decision makers when solving problems that they will encounter in our multicultural, ever-changing world. Our school is an amazing playground where each child discovers his/her true calling and unleashes dreams and hopes for the future. An array of events and activities fill up the APS Srinagr Calender. Inter School Cultural Competitions, Theme based assemblies, Subject Weeks, Sports Meets, Basketball Tournament, Guest Speakers, Seminars, Workshops, Excursions…..the list is long and the enthusiasm for everything is endless. I take immense pride in acknowledging the team-work and efforts of all students and teachers. </p><br>
        <p style="color:white; font-size: 20px;"> At APS Srinagar, we celebrate the wonder and awe of childhood as a trace of God. Our aim is to enhance children’s feelings of self-worth and appreciation of their own and other people’s ethnicity, culture and language in a multi-cultural society.

            You are encouraged to regularly check our website and read about our exciting academic and co-curricular activities. In addition, we ask that you guide and support our children’s learning by ensuring that they:
            
             Attend School daily and arrive on time, ready for the day’s learning experience
            
             Complete all homework assignments given by teachers
            
             Read daily to develop a love for reading and to improve literary skills
            
             Share school experiences with you
            
             Know that you expect them to succeed in School
            
            We all have the potential that is limitless when compared to the extent to which we have our talents. My message is meant to encourage you all  to take the canvas of hope and the brush of a glorious vision and paint your own portrait of excellence!</p>
